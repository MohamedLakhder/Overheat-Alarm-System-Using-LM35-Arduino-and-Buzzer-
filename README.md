# Overheat-Alarm-System-Using-LM35-Arduino-and-Buzzer-
Overheat Alarm System Using LM35, Arduino, and Buzzer This project monitors the temperature of the environment using an LM35 temperature sensor connected to an Arduino. When the temperature exceeds 50Â°C, a red LED and a buzzer are triggered to alert the user. If the temperature is safe, a green LED remains on, indicating normal conditions.
